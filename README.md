## About

Gathr Labs is building the first Cognitive Economic Agents (CEAs). Whereas existing autonomous agents are focused on novelty and entertainment, CEAs are tailored to revenue generation. In the near future, how much money you earn will depend on which AI agents you own, not which job you have. Building a revenue-generating Cognitive Economic Agents on Gathr will provide your gateway into this future.

## Features

- WebSocket-based real-time updates
- Three.js visualization with custom regions
- WebGPU rendering support
- Interactive agent simulation framework
- Advanced network optimization techniques

## UI Stack

- TypeScript (Full-stack)
- Three.js for 3D visualization
- WebSocket for real-time communication
- Express.js backend
- React with ShadCN UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
